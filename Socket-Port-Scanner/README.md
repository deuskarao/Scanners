# Socket-Port-Scanner

## Usage

This is a basic scanner so I do not advise you to scan all the ports 
Specify a range

If you Enter an invalid Ip it will ask you again

If you want better results set time out more than 1 second (default)

It will show you open ports and how many ports are closed in the range you give.
